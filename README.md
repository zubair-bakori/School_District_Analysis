# School_District_Analysis
## Overview:
  The purpose of the PyCity schools district analysis is two-fold. To evaluate the academic performance of high schools throughout the district, but by first dropping reading and   math scores for the ninth grade, which appear suspect, for one of the schools - Thomas High School. This will illuminate the impact of the scores on the on the school's standing   and others in the district.
  
  Secondly, the analysis would show the per capita standing of each school viewed against its performance in the metrics of reading and math.
